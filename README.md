Lead Documentarian for PowerShell at Microsoft. Teacher. Technical Communicator. PowerShell champ.

As a documentarian, I ensure that users have the content they need. I also support and encourage the
PowerShell Community to add value via open-source contributions to the documentation.

I have spent my career helping customers successfully design, deploy, and optimize IT solutions
using Microsoft tools and technologies. I also taught classes on TCP/IP protrocols, scripting,
debugging and crash analysis, and performance tuning.

These days, I am focused on PowerShell, technical writing, and speaking at conferences and user
groups.
